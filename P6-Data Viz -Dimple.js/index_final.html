  <p>From RITA, for the time period of June 2003 to June 2017 a data is collected in order to understand the the overall performance of any U.S. Domestic Airline Carrier. The overall performance is calculated with the help of the delay/cancelled data and arrival data. It is measured by the percentage value of "ON TIME" arrival of any airline for a particular year.</p>
  <p>From the list of all the Airlines, we have selected the top 5 Airlines. Top 5 Airlines are selected by the count of Airlines Carrier present in the dataset.
  In the above graph it showes a general trend that all 5 airlines experienced: an aggregate dip in performance from 2005 to 2007 and another dip between 2012 to 2014. A significant increase in the performace between 2011 to 2013 and again in between 2014 to 2016. We can see how the overall performance of airlines fall and rise with time. Performance of Airlines vary between 70% - 90%.
