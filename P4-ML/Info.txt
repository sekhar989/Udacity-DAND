Identifying Fraud from Enron Emails and Financial Data In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.
In this project, I use machine learning to identify persons of interest based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal, as well as a labeled list of individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.

Introduction
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, there was a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for to executives.
Utilizing scikit-learn and machine learning methodologies, I built a "person of interest" (POI) identifier to detect and predict culpable persons, using features from financial data, email data, and labeled data--POIs who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.
